Deploying transformer models in production presents unique challenges. Here's what I've learned optimizing large language models for real-world applications.

## The Performance Gap

Training transformers is one thing; serving them at scale is another:

- Latency requirements (< 100ms)
- Memory constraints
- Throughput demands
- Cost optimization

## Optimization Techniques

### 1. Model Quantization

Reducing precision while maintaining accuracy:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModel

# Load model
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

# Dynamic quantization
quantized_model = torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(
    model, 
    {torch.nn.Linear}, 
    dtype=torch.qint8
)

# 4x smaller, 2-3x faster inference
```

### 2. Knowledge Distillation

Training smaller "student" models:

- Teacher model: Large, accurate
- Student model: Compact, fast
- Distillation loss: Match teacher's outputs

Results: 40% smaller, 60% faster, 95% accuracy retention

### 3. Pruning and Sparsity

Removing unnecessary weights:

- Magnitude-based pruning
- Structured vs. unstructured
- Gradual pruning during fine-tuning

### 4. Efficient Attention

Optimizing the O(n²) attention bottleneck:

- **Linear attention**: Approximate attention in O(n)
- **Sparse attention**: Only attend to relevant positions
- **Flash Attention**: Kernel-level optimization

## Architecture Choices

### Multi-Query Attention

Reduce KV cache size:

```python
# Standard: separate K, V for each head
# MQA: shared K, V across heads
# Result: 3x faster autoregressive generation
```

### Layer-wise Learning Rates

Lower layers need less fine-tuning:

- Bottom layers: 1e-5
- Middle layers: 5e-5  
- Top layers: 1e-4

## Deployment Stack

    └─────────────┘
```

## Monitoring

Critical metrics to track:

1. **Latency** (p50, p95, p99)
2. **Throughput** (requests/sec)
3. **GPU utilization**
4. **Memory usage**
5. **Error rates**

## Cost Optimization

Real-world savings from optimizations:

| Technique | Latency | Cost Reduction |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Quantization | -40% | -60% |
| Distillation | -60% | -70% |
| Batch optimization | -20% | -50% |
| **Combined** | **-75%** | **-85%** |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Measure first**: Profile before optimizing
2. **Start simple**: Basic quantization gives 80% of gains
3. **Test thoroughly**: Accuracy can degrade subtly
4. **Monitor continuously**: Performance drifts over time

The gap between research and production is real, but with careful optimization, transformer models can be both powerful and practical.
