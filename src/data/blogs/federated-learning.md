# Federated Learning: Privacy-Preserving ML at Scale

**Date:** 2024-01-10  
**Tags:** Federated Learning, Privacy, Distributed ML

Federated Learning enables training machine learning models across decentralized devices without centralizing sensitive data. Here's a deep dive into this paradigm shift.

## The Privacy Problem

Traditional ML requires centralizing data:

```
User Data → Central Server → Train Model → Deploy
```

Problems:
- Privacy violations
- Regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA)
- Data transfer costs
- Security risks

## Federated Learning Architecture

```
┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐
│ Device1 │  │ Device2 │  │ Device3 │
│  Data   │  │  Data   │  │  Data   │
└────┬────┘  └────┬────┘  └────┬────┘
     │            │            │
     └────────────┴────────────┘
                  │
          ┌───────▼────────┐
          │ Central Server │
          │ (Aggregation)  │
          └────────────────┘
```

### Key Steps

1. **Server broadcasts** global model to devices
2. **Devices train** locally on private data
3. **Devices send** model updates (not data!)
4. **Server aggregates** updates
5. **Repeat** until convergence

## Implementation Example

```python
class FederatedServer:
    def __init__(self, model, num_clients):
        self.global_model = model
        self.num_clients = num_clients
    
    def train_round(self, client_data):
        client_updates = []
        
        # Distribute model to clients
        for client_id, data in client_data:
            local_model = self.global_model.copy()
            
            # Client trains locally
            local_model.fit(data, epochs=5)
            update = local_model.get_weights()
            
            client_updates.append(update)
        
        # Federated Averaging (FedAvg)
        self.global_model = self.aggregate(client_updates)
        
    def aggregate(self, updates):
        # Weighted average of client updates
        avg_weights = np.mean(updates, axis=0)
        return avg_weights
```

## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Non-IID Data

Clients have different data distributions:

**Solution**: Personalized federated learning
- Global model + local adaptation layer
- Meta-learning approaches
- Clustered federated learning

### 2. Communication Efficiency

Sending model updates is expensive:

**Solutions**:
- Gradient compression (top-k sparsification)
- Quantization (8-bit, 4-bit gradients)
- Model distillation

```python
def compress_gradients(gradients, compression_ratio=0.01):
    # Keep only top-k% of gradients
    k = int(len(gradients) * compression_ratio)
    top_k_indices = np.argpartition(np.abs(gradients), -k)[-k:]
    
    sparse_gradients = np.zeros_like(gradients)
    sparse_gradients[top_k_indices] = gradients[top_k_indices]
    
    return sparse_gradients  # 100x smaller!
```

### 3. Security Concerns

Model updates can leak information:

**Solutions**:
- Differential privacy (add noise to updates)
- Secure aggregation (encrypted updates)
- Byzantine-robust aggregation

### 4. System Heterogeneity

Devices have different compute power:

**Solutions**:
- Asynchronous updates
- Adaptive learning rates
- Client sampling strategies

## Real-World Applications

### 1. Mobile Keyboards
Google's Gboard uses FL to improve autocorrect without uploading keystrokes

### 2. Healthcare
Hospital collaborations for disease prediction while keeping patient data local

### 3. Financial Services
Fraud detection across banks without sharing transaction data

### 4. IoT Devices
Smart home devices learning patterns without cloud uploads

## Advanced Topics

### Vertical Federated Learning

Different features of same users across organizations:

```
Bank:     [user_id, income, credit_score]
Hospital: [user_id, health_metrics]
Insurance: [user_id, claim_history]

→ Joint model without sharing raw data
```

### Federated Transfer Learning

Pre-trained models adapted via federated learning:

1. Start with ImageNet pre-trained model
2. Federated fine-tuning on edge devices
3. Domain adaptation without data centralization

## Performance Metrics

Evaluating federated systems:

- **Accuracy**: How good is the global model?
- **Communication cost**: Bytes transferred per round
- **Convergence speed**: Rounds to target accuracy
- **Privacy guarantees**: ε in differential privacy

## Future Directions

1. **Cross-device + Cross-silo**: Hybrid architectures
2. **Federated Reinforcement Learning**: RL in distributed settings
3. **Hardware acceleration**: FL-specific chips
4. **Regulation compliance**: GDPR-by-design systems

## Conclusion

Federated Learning represents a fundamental shift in how we think about machine learning:

> **Old paradigm**: Centralize data, train models  
> **New paradigm**: Decentralize training, share knowledge

As privacy regulations tighten and data grows ever more distributed, federated learning will become increasingly critical for real-world ML applications.
